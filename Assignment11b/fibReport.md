1. How many recursive calls are made by the non-memoized brute force version for Fib(30)?
count: 2692537

2. How many calls are made in the memoized version?

- memoized_count: 59 

3. Why does brute-force need dynamic programming?
Beacause brute-force recomputes the same sub-problems over and over, causing exponential time. Dynamic progaming stores these subproblems to compute in linear time.
